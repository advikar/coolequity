"""Phase 2b — residential building footprints, for dasymetric population.

Why this exists
---------------
03_census.py used to split a block group's residents across hexes by AREA. At
H3 res 8 (LA, 0.82 km2) that is a reasonable assumption: a hex is big enough to
average over. At res 9 (San Ramon, 0.11 km2) it is not, and it manufactures
people. Measured on the first San Ramon build: 57 of 540 hexes held >=50
"residents" each while containing zero residential buildings -- 5,850 people,
6.9% of the city, placed on golf courses, ridgelines and the Bishop Ranch office
park. One of them ranked #10 in the city.

Those phantom residents are not harmless. Population is a multiplier in the
score, so an empty hex that inherits people from a populated block group gets
promoted up the priority list, and a planner sent to look at it finds a hillside.

The fix is dasymetric refinement: use building footprints as the mask that says
where people actually are, and split the block group by residential FLOOR AREA
rather than by ground area. This is standard practice in the areal-interpolation
literature, and here it is grounded in measured data -- OSM has 26,346 building
footprints inside the San Ramon bbox, which for a city of ~30k housing units is
effectively complete coverage.

Writes data/buildings_<slug>.geojson: one polygon per residential building, with
its footprint area and an is_multifamily flag. 03 consumes it; 05 uses the flag
to report what kind of housing a hex actually contains, rather than inferring it
from the name of the nearest landmark.
