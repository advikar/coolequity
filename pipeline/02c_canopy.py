"""Phase 2c — measured tree canopy, tree counts, and plantable public space.

Why this replaces the NDVI proxy
--------------------------------
`green` used to be NDVI rescaled to a percentage. NDVI measures *photosynthesis*,
not trees, and in a summer-dry climate that is a decisive difference: an irrigated
lawn is bright green and shades nobody. Measured on San Ramon, the NDVI proxy put
canopy at 21.2% of the ground; two independent real canopy products put it at
9.5% (USFS NLCD) and 11.2% (Meta/WRI canopy height). It was overstating tree
cover by roughly a factor of two, and the excess was grass.

This module uses the Meta/WRI High-Resolution Canopy Height Map: 0.6 m pixels
over California, values in centimetres of vegetation height, free and anonymous
on S3 as cloud-optimised GeoTIFFs. Height is the right instrument, because a lawn
is 0.1 m tall and a tree is not. No classifier, no vegetation index, no seasonal
irrigation signal — just how far off the ground the vegetation is.

KNOWN BIAS, and it must stay on the screen
------------------------------------------
Validated against the one professional ground truth available: the City of
Fresno's UFMP reports 14.6% canopy from 2022 aerial imagery. Over the same city
boundary this product reads 9.1%, and NLCD reads 2.2%. So CHM is about 38% low
against a real aerial assessment, and NLCD is unusable for urban canopy (it is a
forest-cover product). CHM is the best free option and it is still biased low.

Consequence: this pipeline RANKS blocks; it does not certify absolute canopy.
Where CHM and NLCD are both available they agree on ranking (Spearman +0.84) but
share only 12 of their worst 25 blocks — so the ordering is broadly sound and the
exact top of the list is not. The app says this out loud.

What comes out
--------------
  canopy_pct      % of hex ground under vegetation >= CANOPY_MIN_HT_M
  canopy_m2       that as an area
  row_m2          UNSHADED plantable public right-of-way: street centrelines
                  buffered by ROW_HALF_WIDTH_M, minus what already has canopy
  row_canopy_pct  share of that right-of-way already shaded

WHY THERE IS NO TREE COUNT
--------------------------
An individual-tree count was attempted and abandoned, because this data cannot
support one honestly. Two standard methods were tested on San Ramon:

  connected components  764 objects over a 2.35 km2 sample -> 470 m2 each
  local maxima (4-8 m)  1,498-1,639 objects              -> 219-240 m2 each

A real suburban tree crown is 40-80 m2, about 7-10 m across. Both methods return
objects two to six times that size, because Meta's CHM is a smooth modelled
height surface rather than a crisp per-crown model like airborne LiDAR: touching
crowns never separate. Counting them would have produced a number that looks
authoritative and is wrong by a factor of two to five.

So this module reports canopy EXTENT, which the data measures well, and planting
CAPACITY on public land, which is geometry rather than detection. Both are
defensible. "How many trees are there" is not answerable from this source, and
the app must not pretend otherwise.
