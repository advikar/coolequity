"""Phase 4 — the story overlays, plus the names the demo actually talks in.

Three things the score itself can't say:
  * HOLC redlining grade  — why the map looks the way it does (US-only)
  * cooling centers       — where relief already exists
  * walk time to relief   — the access gap, which is the intervention argument

...and one thing the demo can't do without: a human name per hex. H3 cells have
none, and "Hex 2417 is the hottest place in LA" persuades nobody. Names come from
OSM place nodes rather than a US neighborhood file, because OSM has them for
Lagos and Delhi too — same reason the grid is H3 and not census tracts.

Fallback chain, per layer:
  1. live fetch (Mapping Inequality / Overpass)  ->  cached to data/*.geojson
  2. the committed data/*.geojson                ->  fully offline
  3. HOLC/names degrade to null; centers hard-stop (the access layer needs them)

Writes data/overlays.csv: h3, name, holc, access_min, access_km.
