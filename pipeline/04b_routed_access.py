"""Phase 4b — routed pedestrian walk time to the nearest cooling site.

Why this replaces the straight-line estimate (DATA_QUALITY.md W-1)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
04's `access_time` is a circuity-adjusted straight line: crow-fly distance to the
nearest cooling site × C.CIRCUITY (1.273, the grid-Manhattan ratio) ÷ walk speed.
Its documented failure mode is that a hex one freeway, creek or ridgeline away from
a site reads "close" — the straight line ignores barriers, and a fixed circuity
factor cannot know that suburban San Ramon's winding cul-de-sacs are far more
circuitous than a grid.

This module routes on the real OSM **pedestrian network** instead:

  * `osmnx` builds the walk graph for the study bbox (a freeway with no sidewalk is
    simply not in it, so it cannot be crossed; a footbridge over a creek is);
  * one multi-source Dijkstra from every cooling site gives each graph node its
    true network distance to the nearest site (fast — one pass for the whole grid);
  * door-to-door: the point→graph-node snap distance is added at BOTH ends (hex
    centroid and cooling site), and the result is floored at the straight-line
    distance (you cannot walk less than crow-fly), which removes snapping artefacts.

It is computed ONCE, offline, and written into overlays_<slug>.csv, so nothing
routes at demo time. The downloaded graph is cached to
data/_cache/walkgraph_<slug>.graphml so a rerun needs no network.

Validation before trusting it (per DATA_QUALITY.md follow-up 3): the log reports
the largest-connected-component share (should be ~1.0), the routed/crow-fly ratio
distribution (must be ≥1.0 everywhere), and the count of hexes that fell back to
the straight line. Any hex the pedestrian network cannot reach keeps the
straight-line estimate and is marked access_src="straightline".

Two defects found in the September 2026 build (a Bakersfield cell 1.1 km from a
site read 254 min; Contra Costa had 157 cells over 3x the straight line):

  * osmnx's default filter drops every way tagged access=private, i.e. all the
    streets inside gated and private subdivisions. A populated hex with no network
    inside it then snapped 500 m to a farm track that reached town by a 26 km loop.
    Residents can walk out of their own subdivision, so those streets are kept
    (WALK_ACCESS_FILTER) and the graph is re-downloaded to a *_v2 cache.
  * Snapping a point to its single nearest node picks a pocket path over a street
    a few metres further away. Each hex centroid and each site is now joined to
    its SNAP_K nearest nodes and the best door-to-door total wins.

What is still implausibly far (routed > DETOUR_RATIO x crow-fly AND more than
DETOUR_EXTRA_M beyond it) is flagged access_quality="detour-review". If such a
cell is also more than SNAP_MAX_M from any network node, the walking network does
not reach it at all (Bakersfield's far-west cells sit in a 12-node pocket of farm
tracks): the routed figure is then a property of the nearest track, not of the
cell, so the cell keeps the straight-line estimate and says access_src=
"straightline". A flagged cell that IS on the network keeps its routed value —
that is a real barrier, and the flag tells the reader to check it.
